## Database Migration Reference

### Insert Statements Format

For each deliverable, we'll insert:
1. **contract_deliverables** table (5 rows per type)
2. **deliverable_options** table (15 rows per type = 5 deliverables × 3 options)

### Example SQL Structure

```sql
-- Agreement 1, Deliverable 1
INSERT INTO contract_deliverables (
  contract_type,
  deliverable_number,
  title_khmer,
  title_english,
  description_khmer,
  description_english,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  1,  -- contract_type
  1,  -- deliverable_number
  'ឯកសារស្ដង់ដារហាក់ដូច និងនិយមន័យលម្អិតនៃនយោបាយយុទ្ធសាស្ត្រ',
  'National Strategic Policy & Guidance Framework',
  'នយោបាយស្ដង់ដារ ដែលផ្តល់ជូនគបក ដើម្បីអនុវត្តគម្រោង',
  'Comprehensive policy framework and strategic guidance',
  NOW()
);

-- Options for Deliverable 1
INSERT INTO deliverable_options (
  deliverable_id,
  option_number,
  option_label,
  baseline_percentage,
  target_percentage,
  description
) VALUES
  (1, 1, 'Baseline', 85, NULL, 'Basic policy document...'),
  (1, 2, 'Mid-Level', 90, NULL, 'Detailed policy framework...'),
  (1, 3, 'Target', 95, NULL, 'Complete strategic package...');
```

### Total Records to Insert

- **Agreement 1**: 5 deliverables + 15 options = 20 rows
- **Agreement 2**: 5 deliverables + 15 options = 20 rows
- **Agreement 3**: 5 deliverables + 15 options = 20 rows
- **Total**: 60 rows in contract_deliverables + deliverable_options

### Indicator Insert Format

```sql
INSERT INTO indicators (
  indicator_number,
  indicator_name_khmer,
  indicator_name_english,
  created_at
) VALUES
  (1, 'ការអនុវត្តផែនការលម្អិត', 'Plan Implementation Rate', NOW()),
  ...
```

Then link to contracts via `contract_indicators` table with baseline/target values.
